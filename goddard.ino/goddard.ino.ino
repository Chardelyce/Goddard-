  SparkFun Inventorâ€™s Kit
  Circuit 5C - Autonomous Robot

  This robot will drive around on its own and react to obstacles by backing up and turning to a new direction.
  This sketch was adapted from one of the activities in the SparkFun Guide to Arduino.

  This sketch was written by SparkFun Electronics, with lots of help from the Arduino community.
  This code is completely free for any use.
