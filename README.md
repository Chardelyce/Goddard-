# Goddard-
As the robot himself ( this ai says basically ) this is the respo for the java final build of goddards app , this app is a voice assitant there is a handy command guide as well :P this is built on a older API , so upon opening the app you may see a message that says this spp was built for use with older devices message , it had to be downgraded for use with the tablet on the robot itself .. I will post the beta build of the AI and link it here:   https://github.com/Chardelyce/Beta-goddard/tree/main 





- The beta build is an winforms application you can see some parts that I kept and other parts I omitted . Here is a link to the TRELLO for the project (https://trello.com/b/doUfArPw/goddard-ai)
