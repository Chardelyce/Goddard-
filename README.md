<p>&quot;<strong><em>Because a super powered mind will always need a mechanical canine</em></strong>&quot; :)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Presenting Goddard.va , and ofc Goddard himself; a project started in March 2021 rapidly approaching his finish date (for the physical body that is ) on new years! This mechanical good boy has underwent countless iterations whether that be physically from the prototype to the final body or even the AI itself which is what this application is.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While not quite able to do &quot;101 million things &quot; like his fantasy counter part he is able to do 30 - 40 things as of current and more is being added every day ^O^. The application being a voice assistant so thus more of a &quot;slave program&quot; &nbsp;he is not a true free willed robot I figured this would be the best way to go about designing him from watching too many episodes of the series to gather the information and character design I hope to keep improving him and soon there will be the big debut on tiktok till then specs time &gt;:)</p>

    <li>google libraries, tts and purely java</li>
    <li>The beta program which can be found here was built in winform: <a href="https://github.com/Chardelyce/Beta-goddard/tree/main" style='box-sizing: border-box; background-color: rgb(13, 17, 23); color: var(--color-accent-fg); text-decoration: none; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji"; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;'>https://github.com/Chardelyce/Beta-goddard/tree/main</a>&nbsp;</li>

<p>The body was 3d printed but the most interesting part is the arduino itself&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Osyoo model x motor driver</p>
<p>2.Osoyoo uart wifi shield v1.3</p>
<p>3. Everything else is basic arduino components: ultrasonic &nbsp;distance module , a giant battery as well lol etc&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Anyway, im working on more projects besides this there is a game I made as well check it out here:<a href="https://github.com/Chardelyce/Neutron-Blasts" id="isPasted">https://github.com/Chardelyce/Neutron-Blasts</a></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Gotta blast ^^;;</p>
